# Degrdation of Hydrogels 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook developed during my work at Clemson University as Summer Research Intern - 2021. 

`analysis.ipynb` contains the python code for the analysis of the simulation files generated through LAMMPS. In this file, I have extensively used the `subprocess` package of python. `subprocess` essentially allows to run shell commands from the python file itself. 

`compare.ipynb` notebook can be used to plot varoius quantities for the simulation data analyzed using analysis.ipynb. Change the variable dirI, dirII etc. to the path to your analyzed simulation directory.
